Since I was a kid, I've been climbing walls, vaulting rails, and trying flips into the air (and sometimes into injuries). What started as childhood parkour has evolved into a mix of tricking, acrobatics, freerunning, and martial-style movement. These days, you'll find me lifting, flipping, fighting, running and chasing the next way to push my body further.",

While I'm still far from an expert, curiosity has already taken me pretty far: Iâ€™ve experimented with self-designed gene therapies, including myostatin and lactose-related edits, using bacteria I've cultured myself. It's an ongoing journey of trial, error, and discovery, with myself often as the test subject.",
